    #other things we can do:
    # we can add "range(certain number)" if we want it
    #to print numbers from 0 to where we specified but not including the number we wrote
    # between (), or use len(variable) if we want to know how many values or characters inside
    #a variable. or we can use index range(1,6) to print only specific range of numbers
    #but not including the last number which is 6
    #we can add len(variable like blud) inside range() to get the number of characters
    # or values inside the variable but the print statement should include
    # (index[number of the value inside the variable])
